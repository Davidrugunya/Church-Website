				<h4><u>OUR MANDATE</u></h4>
				<p>We aim to continue the ministry that Christ began:Healing, Preaching the Gospel and Teaching his word.</p>
				<section class="floating">
					<h4>BELIEFS</h4>
					<p>We believe that the Bible is God's Word,the product of holy men of old who spoke and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.It is accurate,authoritative and applicable to our everyday lives.
					<br>We believe that mankind was made in the image of God.Every human personality is uniquely created,possesses dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian love.
					</p>
					<p class="extend" id="one">We believe that sin has separated each of us from God and his purpose for  our lives.As a result,man cannot attain a right relationship with God through his own effort.
					<br>We believe that Jesus Christ is the only one who can restore us to God.We believe in His virgin birth,sinless life,miracles and teachings.And that his crucifixion was in our place; the full,fitting payment for our sin.
					<br>We believe that in order to receive forgiveness from God and new birth,we must repent of our sins,believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,and submit to His will for our lives.</p>

					<span class="extend" id="two">
						<h5>Nurturing Believers</h5>
